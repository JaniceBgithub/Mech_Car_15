## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Linear regression was used to determine which factors are important for fuel consumption.   Where the Pr>t values are smaller than 0.05, means that these items are unlikely to be providing random variance.   Therefore vehicle length and ground clearance are the most important factors in predicting fuel consumption.

The slope is not zero because there are factors that affect the fuel consumption. 

The model is a good fit and predictor of fuel consumption with a R2 of 0.7149 and a very low p-value, below 0.05.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The mean and median is close to 1500 for the entire sample, although the standard deviation is likely higher than is good for a precision manufacturing application.

Lot 1 is right on target with a mean of 1500 and a low standard deviation.  Lot 3 is having some issues!!  The mean and median has deviated from 1500 and the standard deviation is high!  Lot 2 is nearly on target, but not quite as good as lot 1.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Linear regression was used to determine which factors are important for fuel consumption.   Where the Pr>t values are smaller than 0.05, means that these items are unlikely to be providing random variance.   Therefore vehicle length and ground clearance are the most important factors in predicting fuel consumption.

The slope is not zero because there are factors that affect the fuel consumption. 

The model is a good fit and predictor of fuel consumption with a R2 of 0.7149 and a very low p-value, below 0.05.
